Title: Thoughts on Sorting
---

Some thoughts on sorting, of course, it's related to time and space complexity: Less is More ;)
Given an array of N number, what's the most natural way of ordering them? It's to compare them one another, and then it's Bubble sort, with 
$$ \binom(N,x) $$ comparison, which is actually the upper bound for sorting problem, since ordered pair is transitive, namely if $$ a \geq b$$ and $$ b \geq c$$ 
then $$ a \geq c$$. Bubble sort is classical, natural but definitely can be optimized! 

```cpp
void Bubble sort(int array[], int n){
   int temp = 0;
   for(int i=0; i<n-1; ++i){ 
      //one i-loop, find maximum!
      //i.e. the last position is correct
      for(int j=0; j<n-1-i; ++j){
         if(array[j] > array[j+1]){
            temp = array[j];
            array[j] = array[i];
            array[i] = array[j];
         }
      }  
   }
   return;
}
```
Bubble sort has time complexity $$ O(N^2)$$.

What did we make progress on Quick Sort then? Actually we utilize one loop search to the most, the comparison of one element with the other N-1 times provides
the info of the correct position of the element itself, so we can divide the array into two parts with the correct position we found as the cutting point, 
and repeat the process separately.

```cpp
void quicksort(int (&array) [n], int l, int r){
   int temp = array[l];
   //This is the value we need help to find correct position this time!
   
   // r-l < 1, recursion condition   
   if(r-l<=1){
      /*if(array[l] < array[r]){
         array[l] = array[r];
         array[r] = temp;
      }*/
      return;
   }
   
   //why not l<r? Think of it!
   while(l<=r){
      while(temp < array[l+]){
         array[l] = array[];
         break;
      }
      array[] = temp;
      
      
   }
   
   quicksort(array,0,);
   quicksort(array,,n-1);
   return;
}
```

One interesting thing is, if we would like to know the maximum or minimum value in the given array of size N, we need to compare N-1 times, but if we need to 
know the value of some position in the middle, it's hard to say whether repeat the process or simply quick sort then check the position: if we are interested 
in location with distance k from the beginning or end as minimum, i.e. $$ k = min(dis(0,pos),dis(pos,n-1)) = min(pos,n-1-pos) $$. It's a comparison between 
$$ nlogn $$, and $$ \frac{(k+1)((n-1)+(n-1-k))}{2} = \frac{(k+1)(2n-2-k)}{2}$$, which is the complexity of quicksort and k-times maximum or minimum finding.
