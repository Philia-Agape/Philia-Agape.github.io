## Heat wave 
Heat is the most commonly studied object in physics (and in our daily life), but we can hardly describe it precisely: if you think temperature is abelian or linear: people do not believe mathematics is simple because they do not realize how complicated life could be ;)



## Statistical Meahanics: Ideal Gas Law
The other classical model comes from the particle approach: we consider the temperature comes from the molecules which consists of the object: air, steel, liquid, or anything else except for the vaccumm. As for the ideal gas, in chemistry we have the ideal gas law
