Magic Cube or Rubik's cube was first invented by Ern≈ë Rubik in 1970s, and it has enjoy high popularity over the past decades. It also varies a lot: from the 
most classical 3 by 3 by 3 cube to $$ n*n*n $$ cube, and many other polyhedron variations...

Back to classical Magic Cube, how to solve it then? First let's consider what types of operations can we apply? Basically, the cube allows three operations at one 
trial (90 degree): from Left to Right, from Up to Down, from Front to Back, and with inverse operation respectively. All these operations can be represented by right hand rules uniquely as well.

Let's label each operation, say L
