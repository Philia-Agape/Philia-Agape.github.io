##Bitwise and Logical

XOR 1  1  0  0 
    1  0  1  0
->  0  1  1  0

XOR 1  1  0  0 
    0  1  0  1 
->  1  0  0  1

Functional Logic? 

Statement in form of X Implies Y can not describe the problem precisely when it comes to quantative speaking

Consider the following statement:

X: Given an integer n, n is greater than 1
Y: The same n, and n is greater than 0

X implies Y, is equivalent to not X or Y 

The logic table for will be 
if X true Y true: n greater than 1; 
if X true Y false: n greater than ;
if X false Y true: n greater than ;
if X false Y false: n less than ;

Consider another example
X:It's your birthday 
Y:You have the cake
