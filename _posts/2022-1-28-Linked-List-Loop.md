LLL! Not [LL](https://www.lovelive-anime.jp/worldwide/)!

To search for the loop inside the linked list, and given the condition that we must come up with an method having O(1) space complexity.

Since recording the list is not allowed, we must use two pointers to implement our idea, just like [rabbit chasing turtle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare)

Now, we assume rabbit's speed is two and turtle's is one, and later will be explained why it's convenient. They represent two pointers pointing to the beginning of the linked list, say the non-loop part, starting from the beginning to the node before the starting node, and
