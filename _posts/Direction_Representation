A very, very tiny but not trivial trick~

Consider the finding path problem, to seek the direction in grid-zone, especially 2D, we have normally saying, left, right, up and down!

ways to represent:

dir = (int**) malloc(4*sizeof(int*));
        for(int i=0; i<4; ++i)
            *dir = (int*) malloc(2*sizeof(int));
    
        for(int i=0; i<4; ++i)
            for(int j=0; j<2; ++j){
               dir[i][j] = pow((-1),i) * i % 2;
               
            }
