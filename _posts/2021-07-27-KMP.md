title: KMP-Find Substring from String
---

pseudo-code for KMT algorithm: find substring from a string by dynamic programming

CODE FOLLOWS:  
```cpp     
        public class KMP {  
        private int[][] dp;  
        private String pat;  
        
       public KMP(String pat) {  
           this.pat = pat;  
           int M = pat.length();  
           //dp[pos][char] pos:index of string  
           //256 character  
           dp = new int[M][256];    
           // base case: If 0 character found, and the character is pat[0], now found 1!  
           dp[0][pat.charAt(0)] = 1;  
           //Xï¼šHunter for Translation Invariant: Longest Substring 
           int X = 0;
           for (int j = 1; j < M; j++) {  
               for (int c = 0; c < 256; c++) {  
                   dp[j][c] = dp[X][c];  
                   //c not in pattern:dp[][c] = 0  
                   dp[j][pat.charAt(j)] = j + 1;    
                   //if pat[X+t] = pat[X] then dp[X][] = dp[X+t][], 
                   //except for dp[X+t][charAt(X+t)] = X+t+1 
                   //e.g. txt:= ABC-ABC-ABC-D, pat:=ABC-ABC-D -> dp[2][A] = 3, dp[5][A] = dp[2][A] = 3 
                   X = dp[X][pat.charAt(j)];    
           }  
    }  
    
    public int search(String txt) {    
        int M = pat.length();    
        int N = txt.length();    
        //pos labels index of pat, starting at 0    
        int pos = 0;    
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {    
            pos = dp[pos][txt.charAt(i)];    
            //pos means already find "pos" matched characters   
            if (pos == M) return i - M + 1;    
        }  
        return -1;  
    }  
}
```

As for the dp array, `dp[int][char]` is the core function: int represents the number# of found matched characters (call it pos) and it would   

increase as current located character corresponds to `pat[pos]`, if not, then it would ask for X, which hunts for the longest substring  

with length l in pattern such that `dp[X+t][] = dp[pos+t][]`.
