As for the dp array, `dp[int][char]` is the core function: int represents the number# of found matched characters (call it pos) and it would   

increase as current located character corresponds to `pat[pos]`, if not, then it would ask for X, which hunts for the longest substring  

with length l in pattern such that `dp[X-t][] = dp[pos-t][]` except for `pat[pos]`ï¼Œwhere 0<= t <=l-1.
