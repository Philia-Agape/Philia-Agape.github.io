Trying to figure out the fork() function and how it works!

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
  
void forkexample()
{
    int x = 1;
  
    if (fork() == 0)
        printf("Child has x = %d\n", ++x);
    else
        printf("Parent has x = %d\n", --x);
}
int main()
{
    forkexample();
    return 0;
}
```

> Parent has x = 0
> 
> Child has x = 2

or , sometimes we could got

> Child has x = 2
>
> Parent has x = 0 

 This is the basic fork example, we divide the main process into parent and child.
 
 ```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
  
void forkexample()
{
    int x = 1;
    int p = fork();
    if (p == 0)
        printf("p = %d, Child has x = %d\n", p, ++x);
    else
        printf("p = %d, Parent has x = %d\n", p, --x);
}
int main()
{
    forkexample();
    forkexample();
    return 0;
}
```

> p = 452163, Parent has x = 0

> p = 0, Child has x = 2

> 
> p = 0, Child has x = 2

 It seems undefined behavior, everytime I try got a different p value and the order is not preserved, indeed p is the pid which identifies the process, since
 the program will be converted to assembly language, the pid depends on the CPU schedule which can not be the same everytime...
 
 ```cpp
 #include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
  
void forkexample()
{
    int x = 1;
    int p = fork();
    if (p == 0)
        printf("p = %d, Child has x = %d, &x = %p\n", p, ++x, &x);
    else
        printf("p = %d, Parent has x = %d, &x = %p\n", p, --x, &x);
}
int main()
{
    forkexample();
    forkexample();
    //forkexample();
    return 0;
}
```

> p = 459780, Parent has x = 0, &x = 0x7fffc2b22060

> p = 459781, Parent has x = 0, &x = 0x7fffc2b22060
> 
> p = 0, Child has x = 2, &x = 0x7fffc2b22060
> 
> p = 0, Child has x = 2, &x = 0x7fffc2b22060
> 
> p = 459782, Parent has x = 0, &x = 0x7fffc2b22060

 The interesting thing is, though we divide the process, the address of x is the same.
 
 ```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
   (fork()) && (fork() || fork());
  
   printf("forked\n");
   return 0;
}
```

>forked

>forked

 
 The explanation here, is because the && operand has more priority than ||, and && will continue right hand only if left hand is not zero, || will continue 
 left hand only if left hand is zero, and the return value of a successful fork, will assign parent a PID, which is an unsinged int, positive, greater than 0, 
 and will assign zero to child. If the fork is a failure, it will assign -1 to parent, and no child is created. 
 
 So the main process fork first to create a child C1, and the return value of main is a PID greater than zero, but zero for C1, so C1 will not fork but print,
 main will continue to fork a child C2, with main a PID and C2 a zero, and main will not fork, but C2 will fork and create C3, and C3 will print, so it's a 
 total of four forked output.
 
 By the way, I think I've known star well enough, just kidding...
