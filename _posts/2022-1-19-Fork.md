Trying to figure out the fork() function and how it works!

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
  
void forkexample()
{
    int x = 1;
  
    if (fork() == 0)
        printf("Child has x = %d\n", ++x);
    else
        printf("Parent has x = %d\n", --x);
}
int main()
{
    forkexample();
    return 0;
}
```

> Parent has x = 0
> 
> Child has x = 2

or , sometimes we could got

> Child has x = 2
>
> Parent has x = 0 

 This is the basic fork example, we divide the main process into parent and child.
 
 ```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
  
void forkexample()
{
    int x = 1;
    int p = fork();
    if (p == 0)
        printf("p = %d, Child has x = %d\n", p, ++x);
    else
        printf("p = %d, Parent has x = %d\n", p, --x);
}
int main()
{
    forkexample();
    forkexample();
    return 0;
}
```

 It seems undefined behavior, everytime I try got a different p value and the order is not preserved, indeed p is the pid which identifies the process, since
 the program will be converted to assembly language, the pid depends on the CPU schedule which can not be the same everytime...
 
 ```cpp
 #include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
  
void forkexample()
{
    int x = 1;
    int p = fork();
    if (p == 0)
        printf("p = %d, Child has x = %d, &x = %p\n", p, ++x, &x);
    else
        printf("p = %d, Parent has x = %d, &x = %p\n", p, --x, &x);
}
int main()
{
    forkexample();
    forkexample();
    //forkexample();
    return 0;
}
```

 The interesting thing is, though we divide the process, the address of x is the same.
 
 ```cpp
 #include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
   fork() && fork() || fork();
  
   printf("forked\n");
   return 0;
}
```

 By the way, I think I've known star well enough, just kidding...
